# Removista
My final year project entitled Removista was an android application to remove obstructions from photos.
Main objective of this project was to develop a compact library using OpenCV that can be used within mobile camera to remove background, and foreground objects, that are causing obstruction in the photo. The library was designed to process any kind of images. 
The source code was developed using Java and OpenCV. All the images captured by the system are processed by an Image Processing technique called Background Subtraction. 
In order to achieve the desired outcome, we had to learn the fundamentals of Image Processing and techniques. By using various methods to extrapolate data out of images.
The application was capable of identifying and removing unwanted objects. The removed objects were quantized and extracted from the primary image and finally all the noises 
and degradation were eliminated.
